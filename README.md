# Chatbot using LangChain and OpenAI Embedded API

#### This project features a chatbot that offers personalized responses to user queries. By combining custom files and tapping into OpenAI's vast database, the chatbot tailors answers for a more personalized interaction. The magic happens behind the scenes, making it easy to use and adapt.

#### This project implements a chatbot using LangChain and integrates with OpenAI's Embedded API for natural language processing. The core functionality is set up using the llama_index library, including classes such as SimpleDirectoryReader, GPTVectorStoreIndex, and utilities like load_index_from_storage. The chatbot leverages the OpenAI class from the LangChain llms module to enhance its language processing capabilities.

#### Additionally, system-related functionalities are handled through sys and os, while the IPython.display module facilitates Markdown rendering, making the chatbot suitable for presentation in IPython notebooks.
